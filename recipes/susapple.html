        <h3>Description</h4>
        <p>The <strong>susapple</strong> is much like an apple, except it is undoubtedly
            suspicious, which is where it gets its name from - the sus-apple.</p>

        <p>Many believe that the <strong>susapple</strong> grows from a susapple tree,
            however this is false. the susapple is a product of fusing the sus gene
            with an ordinary apple.</p>
